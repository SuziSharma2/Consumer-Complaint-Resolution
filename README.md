# Consumer Complaint Resolution Analysis Using Python
# Product review is the most basic function/factor in resolvingcustomer issues and increasing the sales growth of any product.We can understand their mindset toward our service without asking each customer.When consumers are unhappy with some aspect of a business, they reach out to customer service and might raise a complaint. Companies try their best to resolve the complaints that they receive. However, it might not always be possible to appease every customer.So Here, we will analyze data, and with the help of different algorithms, we are finding the best classification ofcustomer category so that we can predict our test data.
# Objective: Use Python libraries such as Pandas for data operations, Seaborn and Matplotlib for data visualization and EDA tasks, Sklearn for model building and performance visualization, and based on the best model,make a prediction for the test file and save the output.The main objective is to predict whether our customer is disputed or not with the help of given data.
